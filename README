Changes in r4
Upgraded to libusb-1.0

Changes in r3
Added more documentation about the protocol used
Defined new pin constants
The USB interface is only claimed and set when necessary. This fixes the problem that when the program
gets started the values are reset to 0.

The best documentation I found about iosolution.

= The goal =

The goal of this project is to offer an easy to use software interface to the
[http://www.elomax.nl/site/usb/iosolution.html iosolution] based hardware. 

The last release r3 (01-06-2008) provides better support for reconnecting 
multiple time to the same hardware without forcing a reset.

= The alternatives =
The iosolution "chip" from elomax offers a cheap and easy to use USB IO expander. This small c library offers a userland tool to control the IO expander. An alternative is Klaas noordstra's kernel module see [http://klaas.noordstra.nl/iosolution.xhtml his website].
